# VBA-challenge
In this challenge, a VBA script is used to analyse generated stock market data to achieve the following.

Created a script that loops through all the stocks for one year: 

- Yearly change from the opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.

- The percentage change from the opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.

- The total stock volume of the stock.

- Add functionality to your script to return the stock with the "Greatest % increase", "Greatest % decrease", and "Greatest total volume".
